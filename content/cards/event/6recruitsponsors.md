### Recruit Sponsors

There are a number of costs that are associated with running a hackathon including food, supplies, venue, and volunteers' time. Finding sponsors to help offset these costs (and to engage in your event) is important and should be started early.

- [ ] Reach out to local businesses, community foundations, and startup groups 
- [ ] Look for in-kind donations such as venue, food, and use of software platforms or hosted space

Optional, but helpful: 
- [ ] Create a sponsorship packet describing your event with different levels of sponsorship, including options for in-kind donations 
- [ ] If your event costs are particularly high, dedicate a single person to pursuing sponsorship for the event
