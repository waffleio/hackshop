### Find a Venue

Venues can make or break an event. A good venue will help you to ensure that the event runs smoothly, while a bad one will cause you to bounce around like a pinball trying to fix last minute everythings.

#### What to Look for in a Venue
- [ ] Easy to find location, ideally near mass transit
- [ ] Proper venue size for expected attendance
- [ ] ADA Accessible
- [ ] Wifi network that can handle a hundred people at once (not always easy)
- [ ] Plenty of places to plug in or the ability to place more power strips out
- [ ] Access to projectors and screens
- [ ] A staff member that can be there during the event


#### Items to Have on Hand (if venue does not provide)
- [ ] Dongles (Because nobody has a laptop that will connect to your projector. You need one that links to VGA, Mac to HDMI, Mac to VGA, etc.)
- [ ] Name Badges
- [ ] Snacks, Water, and Pop (remember to bring the healthy stuff)
- [ ] Power strips
- [ ] Post-it notes
- [ ] White Boards / Paper Easels
- [ ] Microphones / PA system
- [ ] Projector, Screen
- [ ] USB Drives
- [ ] Swag (laptop stickers, t-shirts)
- [ ] Directional signage (Whereâ€™s the bathroom?)
- [ ] First aid kit (just in case! :))
