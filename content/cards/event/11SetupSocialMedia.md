### Setup your Social Media

Set up your social media hashtag at least a few weeks prior to your event and make the hashtag known on your registration page. 

- For CodeAcross, we use the #codeacross hashtag
- For National Day of Civic Hacking we use #hackforchange. 
- If you have your own hashtag that you use for your regular Brigade Meetups, use that too. 

Tweeting and posting throughout the day will help encourage other people in the community as well as help set up a timeline of events. This will make it easier to blog about your event later.

- [ ] Designate someone to craft promotional tweets leading up to the event 
- [ ] Designate someone to live tweet throughout the event using the relevant hashtags (assign this person to #18)
