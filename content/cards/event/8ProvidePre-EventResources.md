### Provide Pre-Event Resources

Don't wait until the day of the event to provide your participants with resources! Hackathons may have challenge components, but that doesnâ€™t mean everyone absolutely has to start from scratch.

- [ ] Create a resource list ahead of time to prepare participants for the event. Examples include user stories, data sets, problem statements, and contact information from SME's who have agreed to participate.
- [ ] Make these resources accessible to registrants on your event website, via email, or both.
