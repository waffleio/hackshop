### Recruit Stakeholders

Now that we've decided what problem(s) to focus on (#1), it's time to recruit stakeholders and SME's to help us better understand the problem context. 

- [ ] Find and recruit 2-3 subject matter experts who deal with your problem context on a daily basis
- [ ] Invite these SME's to be a part of crafting problem statements in advance or adding context to your problem set
- [ ] Invite SME's to participate in the event, either through speaking, joining teams, judging, or giving feedback
