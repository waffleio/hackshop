### Focus on the Problem 

Hackathons work best when focused on a specific problem set. Want to do a hackathon about crime? Better call the police department. Want to do something around housing? Recruit somebody from the local housing authority or somebody who runs a shelter. When trying to think about the needs and challenges of the front line, thereâ€™s no substitute for somebody who actually works in that space to speak at your event and to help you identify the right problems to be solved.

- [ ] Decide on one or two *themes* for your event
- [ ] Identify potential problem areas within these themes to set a "problem context" 
- [ ] Once identified, move on to recruiting SME's/Stakeholders to help you better understand the problems within the themes/problem context (#4)
