Reaching out to the press can be a great way to attract people to the event and to help tell your story after the event. 

Code for America Brigade organizers should refer to the [Brigade Organizer playbook](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/organize/playbook/)  for tips on interacting with the press, or reach out in Slack!
