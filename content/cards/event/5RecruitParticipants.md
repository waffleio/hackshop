### Recruit Participants

Once you have an agenda, it’s time to Recruit! Recruit! Recruit! In order to get people to your event, you’ll need to start early. 

Additionally, you’ll also want to make sure you have a diverse skill set at your event. The best teams at hackathons are comprised of a mix of skillsets including developers, user interface designers, data scientists, and subject matter experts.


#### Choose a Way for Participants to Register
There’s a few ways that you can do registration for the event. For events run by existing groups or meetups, Meetup.com is great because it allows discussions on the event page and helps to carry the movement on afterwards (since you’ll have people joining your meetup group when they register for the event.) Eventbrite.com is also a great option. Both options have the ability to schedule pre and post event emails for keeping in communication with your registrants and attendees. 
- [ ] Decide on hosting registration at meetup.com, eventbrite.com, or elsewhere

#### Spread the Word!
- [ ] Identify and contact any current, relevant email lists, contacts with local universities, company contacts, and news media contacts to help spread the word
- [ ] Identify organizations or groups you can contact to promote an inclusive and diverse audience for your event 
- [ ] Recruit a variety of skill sets including developers, UI designers, data scientists, and SME's through Meetup groups, web development schools/bootcamps, and universities
- [ ] Ask any groups with similar interests to cross-post your event to their audience, or to attend their next event in person to spread the word
