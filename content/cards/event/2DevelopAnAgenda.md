### Develop an Agenda

Your agenda will vary depending on the goal of your hackathon and it’s something that you should determine early on in your planning.

There’s a temptation to have hackathons become two day sprints with participants getting little to no sleep. However, if the goal of the hackathon is to develop prototypes versus fully working apps, you may not need really need to make a coffee run at 2 in the morning.

#### One Day Hackathon Example

- 7:00am Event organizers arrive to help set up
- 7:30am Food/Coffee/Water arrives
- 8:00am Breakfast
- 8:30am Welcome (“Hi, welcome! Here’s the wifi password, the bathrooms are over there.”)
- 8:45am Education (“Here’s what we’ve done so far, here are some resources”) [You can also cover this in a pre-event email]
- 9:00am Problem Set (“Here’s the problem I’m facing in the day-to-day”) [You can also cover this in a pre-event email]
- 10:00am Q & A (“Would this be helpful?” “How does this activity work?”)
- 10:15am Break out to form teams and hack! (If using Hackshop format for attendees, begin facilitation of Hackshop format alongside the attendee guide at http://hackshop.waffle.io)
- 12:00pm Lunch served
- 4:00pm Hacking ends, judging begins (if applicable)
- 4:30pm Project winners announced (If applicable)

Variations on this include having the talking portion of the event happen on a Friday night. (This is particularly helpful if you’re trying to have working prototypes by the end of the event.) This allows for a full day (or full two days) of hack time.
