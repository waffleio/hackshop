### Check A/V

Audio and visual equipment can be a bit temperamental. It's best to check the A/V equipment the day before and get familiar with it so you can use be better prepared to use it. Keep in mind, nobody carries around the adapters to make things work with their specific computer and so you may want to check to see if they have at least a VGA, HDMI, Mini-HDMI adapters.

It may also be useful to have a spare USB. This way, you can at least be sure that your computer works and can transfer slides over if needed.
