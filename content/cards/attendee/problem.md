### Is the problem worth solving?

When deciding on what projects to build at Code for Denver, one of our primary concerns is the impact a given project will have on the community. This is why we emphasize the user aspect of the project: does this project benefit an identifiable group of people? Can you find real persons to test prototypes and the MVP? If you can’t identify who will benefit, and this project can’t be quantified in terms of users and user-testable MVPs, then this project might not be a good fit for Code for Denver. 

There is no ego associated with a project, so it’s not a personal reflection on you or your interests if the problem isn’t a good fit. It’s entirely okay to do some research and determine that a project isn’t worth solving or not a good fit for CFD.

#### Try a lean canvas model

A lean canvas is a great way to lay out key components of your project success model so you can start testing your assumptions and get to building something customers want *as fast as possible*.

To create a free digital version of a lean canvas, go to [Canvanizer](https://canvanizer.com/new/lean-canvas). Alternatively, you can print [this lean canvas](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/100216/12663330/7f1ced9e-c5e4-11e5-9a5d-87582d98bfc3.png)

#### How to write a problem statement

Choose one of these two formats, and write down your problem:

- I believe `[type of people]` experience `[type of problem]` when doing `[type of task]`
- I believe `[type of people]` experience `[type of problem]` because of `[limit or constraint]`

You can have more than one problem statement, but no more than 3.
