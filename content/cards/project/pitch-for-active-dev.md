## Pitch for Active Development

If you have gotten this far, and have completed all the previous cards you should be confident to move this into the `Active Development` phase and build a minimum viable product. (If you don't feel this way, it is totally fine to not move forward with the project)

To pitch for active development to the group, coordinate a time on the weekly agenda to take five minutes to update the group on the state of the project (this does not need to happen on standard 1st Monday of the month pitch night).

The purpose of this pitch is to present the state of the project, and pitch that it is worth putting the effort in to develop the MVP.

There are a few specific things that we'd love for you to preset:
- who is the partner organization
- who are the users
- MVP mockup
- show overview of research
  - what already exists
  - how do you know this solution will be valuable

Similar to the original pitch, there might be a call for further refinement, and a request to hold while work in progress is wrapped up before moving forward.

Hope to get your MVP developed shortly! :smile:
