### Brainstorm Solutions

- [ ] Using a [timer](https://www.google.com/#q=timer), take 5 minutes to write down as many rough ideas on sticky notes as you can.

- [ ] Go around as a team and put your sticky notes on a wall as you say what you wrote.

- [ ] Group similar ideas together.

When you're finished, you're ready to move on to creating paper prototypes!
