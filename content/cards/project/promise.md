#### What is a UVP? 
Your unique value proposition is the promise you're making to your customer that's compelling enough for them to jump on board.

#### Writing a UVP
Here are two suggested formats: 

1) Ask yourself: "If I solve *the problem* `[by doing this]` for *my customer*, is that compelling?" 

When you can substitute `[by doing this]` with something compelling, that's the Unique Value Proposition you're proposing.

2) Complete the statement: "I can promise [the customer in Box 1] who faces [the problem in Box 2] that I can give them [unique value proposition in Box 3]."

Lastly, don't forget to fill out the `High Level Concept`! This serves as a clear way to describe who you are. For Uber, this would be "Order a taxi with your phone." It can also be an 'x for y' concept like "Instagram for Pet Lovers."
