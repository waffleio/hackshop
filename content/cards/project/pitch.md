## How to Pitch

### 1. The Hook (30-60 seconds)

Pull the audience in. Keep it short.
Tell a story, or make us laugh, but make sure you clearly define the problem and convince us that your problem is worth solving.

### 2. Sell the Solution

The hook should have us on the edge of our seats, because we're rooting for you. We want you to succeed, we want this problem to be solved.

So tell us how you solved it, and for who. Convince us that it's not just you who thinks this solution is awesome, show us your validation. Talk about any pivots you made along the way, and why you have validation that you're on the right track. 

### 3. What's next?

What are your next steps? 
Where are you going to take it? 
If you've sold us on it, we'll want to help you. Tell us how to help.
