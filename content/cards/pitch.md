## This is how to pitch.

### 1. The Hook

Pull the audience in. Keep it short, 30 seconds or a minute. 
Tell a story, or make us laugh. But make sure it's convincing us that your problem is worth solving.

### 2. Sell the Solution

The hook should have us on the edge of our seats, because we're rooting for you. We want you to succeed, we want this problem to be solved.

So tell us how you solved it, and for who. Convince us that it's not just you who thinks this solution is awesome, show us your validation.

### 3. Make an Ask

What are your next steps? 
Where are you going to take it? 
If you've sold us on it, we'll want to help you. Tell us how to help.
